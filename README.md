I have provided the exe file for this game so you don't need to install python on your system. Just run the exe file and you can play this game. **Note that you have to install the Assets folder on your computer otherwise the game will not work.** Just click on the green button on the repository and download the zip file. Then extract it and then run the exe file, It will run without any errors.
